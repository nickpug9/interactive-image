              A year-round destination that serves as a model for future
              waterfront urban development through the United States and around

              Perkins Eastman led the design and implementation of a visionary
              urban district known today as District Wharf, completely
              transforming and revitalizing a historic section of Washington,
              D.C. Beginning with a comprehensive water plan, the team created
              an integrated, state-of-the art new standard for public realm,
              architecture and planning that honors site, history, and
              community. District Wharf is a vibrant neighborhood encompassing a
              wide range of commercial, residential, and public uses. With
              expansive new piers, buildings, and promenades shaping dynamic
              spaces for people to gather, District Wharf is a place for all to
              enjoy life at the water's edge.
